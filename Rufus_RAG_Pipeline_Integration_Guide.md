# Integrating Rufus into a RAG Pipeline

## **Introduction to RAG Pipelines**
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is a system where relevant data is retrieved from external sources and passed to a language model for generating contextually accurate responses. RAG pipelines are commonly used in chatbots, question-answering systems, and AI assistants.

Rufus plays a key role in the *retrieval* phase of the pipeline by intelligently scraping and synthesizing web content based on specific instructions.

---

## **Steps to Integrate Rufus**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Before integration, ensure:
- You have Rufus running locally or hosted on a server.
- Your RAG system has a retriever (e.g., a search engine or database query component) and a generator (e.g., OpenAI GPT or Google Gemini).

### **2. Rufus as the Retriever**
Rufus can act as an intelligent retriever that:
- Dynamically scrapes web pages.
- Synthesizes content relevant to a query.
- Returns structured data ready for downstream processing.

### **3. Workflow Integration**
#### **Step 1: Configure Rufus API**
Set up Rufus to scrape websites based on user input:
- URL: Specify the target website.
- Instructions: Describe what data needs to be retrieved (e.g., "Extract awards and recognition details").
- Depth: Define how many levels of nested links to crawl (default: 2).

### Example Request:
POST /scrape HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

```bash
    {
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli",
        "instructions": "how many awards has virat kohli won and what are those"
    }
```

#### **Step 2: Use the Response as Context**
The Rufus response contains a filtered_content field with relevant data. Feed this into your generator model.

### Example Rufus Response:
```bash
    {
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli",
        "title": "Virat Kohli - Wikipedia",
        "filtered_content": "Virat Kohli has won 10 ICC awards. Awards include: ICC ODI Player of the Year (4 times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023), Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (2 times in 2017 and 2018), ICC Test Player of the Year (2018). He was also named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years (2016-2018)."
    }
```


#### **Step 3: Feed the Data into the Generator**
Pass the filtered_content to the LLM for generating responses. For example:
- **OpenAI GPT**:
  
```bash  
    #python
    from openai import ChatCompletion

    context = response['filtered_content']
    query = "Summarize the awards Virat Kohli has won."
    prompt = f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {query}"

    completion = ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    print(completion["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

- **LangChain Example**:
```bash  
    #python
    from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
    from langchain.chains import LLMChain
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI

    llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4")
    template = PromptTemplate(template="{context}\n\n{query}", input_variables=["context", "query"])
    chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=template)

    context = response['filtered_content']
    query = "What awards has Virat Kohli won?"
    result = chain.run(context=context, query=query)
    print(result)
```

#### **Step 4: Provide the Output to End Users**
Deliver the output from the LLM to your chatbot, API client, or other consumer systems.

## **Rufus Integration Example**

Here’s a high-level example of integrating Rufus into a RAG pipeline:

1. **User Input**: A user queries: *"What awards has Virat Kohli won?"*
2. **Rufus Scrapes**: Rufus scrapes the relevant Wikipedia page for details about Virat Kohli’s awards.
3. **Rufus Returns Data**: Rufus synthesizes content into a structured response.
4. **LLM Processes Data**: The RAG pipeline uses the Rufus response as context to generate an answer.
5. **Output**: The user receives a detailed response about Virat Kohli’s awards.

## **Benefits of Using Rufus in RAG Pipelines**
1. **Dynamic Retrieval**:
   - Unlike static retrieval systems, Rufus crawls live web pages, ensuring the data is always up-to-date.

2. **Precision**:
   - By leveraging Google Gemini LLM for content filtering, Rufus ensures only relevant information is passed to the generator.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Rufus’s modular architecture makes it easy to integrate into existing RAG systems or scale to larger datasets and domains.

4. **Customizability**:
   - Users can define specific instructions to tailor data extraction for their needs.

---

## **Considerations for Production Integration**
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensure Rufus respects target websites' rate limits and terms of service.
- **Error Handling**: Handle cases where Rufus fails to retrieve or synthesize data.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed URLs to reduce redundant scraping.
- **Security**: Replace the test credentials with secure, environment-managed keys for production.
